          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is a white, crystalline inorganic compound
            commonly used in various industrial applications. It is highly
            soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. One of its primary
            uses is in the production of lithium-ion batteries, where it acts as
            a precursor material. Lithium hydroxide is also used as a carbon
            dioxide scrubber in spacecraft and submarines due to its ability to
            absorb CO2. In the ceramics industry, it serves as a flux to lower
            the melting point of silica. Additionally, it is utilized in the
            production of lubricating greases, where it thickens oils. LiOH is
            known for its caustic nature, requiring careful handling and
            storage. It reacts readily with acids to form lithium salts. The
            compound plays a critical role in the modern energy storage and
            aerospace industries, contributing significantly to technological
            advancements.
